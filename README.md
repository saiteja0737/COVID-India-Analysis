COVID-19 India Analysis
An Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Visualization Project on COVID-19 Trends in India

Project Overview:
This project provides an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of COVID-19 trends in India, covering key aspects such as:
1. Active Cases Trends
2. Vaccination Analysis (State-wise & Gender-wise)
3. Recovery & Mortality Rates
4. State-wise Heatmaps & Treemaps
5. Correlation Between Vaccinations & Active Cases

The project utilizes Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to perform data analysis and visualization.

Dataset:
The dataset used for this analysis contains state-wise COVID-19 case records, vaccination data, and demographic insights.

Key Insights & Findings:
a. Vaccination Impact: A significant increase in vaccinations is correlated with a decrease in active COVID-19 cases.
b. State-wise Trends: States with higher population density showed more active cases, but also a higher recovery rate.
c. Gender-based Vaccination Disparity: Slightly higher vaccination rates among males compared to females.
d. Recovery & Mortality Rates: Recovery rates are consistently high across most states, with some variations in mortality rates.
